# relativebilbying

This code is a complement to the `bilby` package and enables one to perform relative binning in [`bilby`](https://git.ligo.org/tomasz.baka/bilby). The code can use waveform with higher order modes and precession to perform parameter estimation. The code is also able to peform joint parameter estimation for strongly lensed events. 

Relative binning is a method to perform bayesian parameter inference for gravitational waves in a faster way. It has been developped in [Zackay et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08792.pdf), [Dai et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08793.pdf), and [Dai et al, repo](https://bitbucket.org/dailiang8/gwbinning/src/master/). Additionally, attempts have been made to develop relative binning for higher-order modes waveforms (see [Leslie et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09872.pdf)). 

In this repo, we use the ideas from [Zackay et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08792.pdf) and convert them into a bilby compatible format, making it easier to use.

The codebase to perform PE with IMRPhenomXPHM waveform is based on the work by [Narola et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12140.pdf)
